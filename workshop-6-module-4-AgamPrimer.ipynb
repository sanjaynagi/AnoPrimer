In this module, we introduce a new python package [AgamPrimer](https://github.com/sanjaynagi/AgamPrimer), which uses the [malariagen_data API](https://malariagen.github.io/vector-data/ag3/api.html) and [primer3-py](https://github.com/libnano/primer3-py), to allow us to design primers and probes in *Anopheles gambiae s.l*. We can use then use these primers and probes to help us validate putative resistance loci. By integrating the malariagen_data API, AgamPrimer allows us to consider and avoid genetic variation in the Ag1000g resource during the design of our primers."

        "  - Between 17-24 bases long\n",

        "Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in primer binding sites can affect both the stability and *Tm* of the primer-template duplex, as well as the efficiency with which DNA polymerases can extend the primer (Figure 2). In some cases, this can completely prevent primer binding and amplification of the template DNA, often referred to as null alleles. Null alleles can become particular troublesome when performing PCR on pooled samples, where we may not observe whether all samples amplified successfully, and so we may not be sampling and observing the full range of alleles.\n",
        "\n",
        "An equally problematic scenario may occur if primers bind but with unequal efficiency against different genetic variants. In this case, in any quantitative molecular assay such as qPCR for gene expression, SNPs could lead to biases in the estimation of gene expression between genetic variants or strains. Even single SNPs can introduce a variety of effects, ranging from minor to major impacts on Cq values <sup>[6]</sup>. The effect will depend on the type of SNP (which nucleotides are involved), and on the position of the SNP (3’ or 5’ end), as SNPs within the last 5 nucleotides at the 3’ end can disrupt the nearby polymerase active site, and so these tend to have a much greater impact <sup>[7]</sup>. SNPs at the terminal 3’ base had the strongest shift of Cq, altering Cq by as much as 5–7 cycles (Figure 2).\n",

You can find a SNP in less than every 2 bases of the accessible genome - which makes considering SNPs even more important when designing molecular assays.

        "We can use a cool new python package, [gget](https://github.com/pachterlab/gget), to rapidly search our primers against the AgamP3 genome, to ensure they will not amplify any other regions of the genome. gget rapidly queries large databases - in this case we can use the program BLAT to align primer sequences. Unfortunately as the lengths of primer sequences are so short, it is at the limit of BLATs sensitivity, and in some cases, matches are not returned. gget can also currently only query the older AgamP3 assembly. Therefore, it is also recommended run a more exhaustive search in [Primer-BLAST](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/)."
